# Tykki-Musik

This is a static and free version of Tykki's Musik web app. The full scope of this app is to enable web playback of songs from users spotify accounts, while also linking to their fb accounts to chat with other users of the app. Also other users in  your area from the geo-location in the map section. A simple profile is generated and the ability to follow others and include status updates. Due to this being the free version, the scope is reduced to the following requirement for the IT 202 big project rubric.
